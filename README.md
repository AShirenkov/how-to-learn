# how-to-learn

How to learn is my first, completely independent, web development project in Yandex Practicum
In this project, the skills of creating web pages using BEM are being practiced.
Such types of animation as opacity and rotation are used.
Various examples of positioning are carried out - absolute and relative
I'm going to develop the project further with the integration of feedback forms
